# Approximating Pi

Approximating the value of Pi with JavaScript (p5js library)

## Usage

There are two sketch script:  
The V1 sketch scipt will not keep track of the best approximation of Pi, but the V2 will. Therefore the value of Pi will be accurate for about 6-7 digits with the V2 script, but only for about 3-4 digits with the V1.

You can choose the amount of dots generated per frame to speed up or down the approximation.

By default the V2 sketch script is used.
